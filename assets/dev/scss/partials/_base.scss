// Quoting from https://smacss.com/book/categorizing
// "Base rules are the defaults. They are almost exclusively single element 
//  selectors but it could include attribute selectors, pseudo-class selectors, 
//  child selectors or sibling selectors. Essentially, a base style says that 
//  wherever this element is on the page, it should look like this."
