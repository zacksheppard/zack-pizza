# zack.pizza

My site for pizza themed coding projects.

## Development

Run the following commands in different tabs

```sh
npm start
```

```sh
npm run watch-css
```

## Deploying to GitHub Pages

To deploy:

```sh
npm run deploy
```

If the deploy doesn't pick up all changes, run `npm run build` before deploy.

__Note:__ This project uses the [GitHub Pages npm module](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gh-pages) so it isn't necessary to manually merge into the gh-pages branch and shouldn't have to touch it in development at all. 

Project bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) ([FAQs](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md)).
